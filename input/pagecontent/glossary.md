|Administrative Cost|Non-clinical costs|
|**Alternative Payment Models (APMs)**|Alternative payment models deviate from traditional fee-for-service (FFS) payment, insofar as they adjust FFS payments to account for performance on cost and quality metrics, or insofar as they use population-based payments that are linked to quality performance.[source](http://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/ds-whitepaper-final.pdf)|
|**Average Risk Score**|Average risk score for the population, which is a numeric score where a higher score indicates a riskier population on average. Note that within that population, each patient also has risk score, which helps to know which patient is more riskier.|
|Bonus Amount|BP models may reward quality and cost savings separately, or they may link them. When treated separately, there is a discrete quality bonus, irrespective of the provider’s performance relative to their financial benchmark.|
|Brand|Brand( for example Blue vs. non-blue)|
|**Capitation**|A fixed amount of money per patient per unit of time paid in advance to the physician (or health care provider) for the delivery of health care services.
