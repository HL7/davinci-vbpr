# Value-based performance reporting has the use case of needing to stratify MeasureReport.group using locally defined stratifiers such as regions within the provider organization. The MeasureReport.group.stratifier definition says "When a measure includes multiple stratifiers, there will be a stratifier group for each stratifier defined by the measure." 
# CQI WG discussed and agreed that this is a use case MeasureReport should support, the WG will work on approaches to support this in the future (https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/2024-04-26+Meeting+Minutes) (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-42736).
