# CQI WG agreed that there is a need to support stratifying MeasureReport.group using locally defined stratifiers such as regions within a provider organization. The WG will work on approaches to support this use case in the future (https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/2024-04-26+Meeting+Minutes) (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-42736).

# WARNING: The code has an extensible binding to Performance Metric value set. This particular example intentionally used some locally defined performance metrics to demonstrate how to report on metrics that are not defined in the Performance Metric code system.
